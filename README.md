# Medical Emergency Assistance Web Application

This repository contains a **Medical Emergency Assistance Web Application** that helps individuals in urgent medical need by connecting them with nearby volunteers. The application features real-time location tracking, volunteer notification, user authentication, and an SOS button that sends the user's current location to pre-selected contacts.

## Features

- **User Registration and Login**: Secure user authentication to ensure only authorized users can access the platform.
- **Real-Time Location Tracking**: Tracks users' current location and helps volunteers find them in case of emergencies.
- **Volunteer Notification**: Notifies nearby volunteers when a medical emergency is reported.
- **SOS Button**: Allows users to send an SOS signal along with their current location to emergency contacts.
- **Google Maps Integration**: Real-time maps powered by Google Maps API for location tracking.
- **MySQL Database**: Efficient data storage for user details, location information, and volunteer tracking.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Django (Python)
- **Database**: MySQL
- **APIs**: Google Maps API

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Suhanipargal/medical-emergency-assistance.git
   cd medical-emergency-assistance
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up the MySQL database:
   - Create a new MySQL database for the project.
   - Update the `settings.py` file with your database configuration:
     ```python
     DATABASES = {
         'default': {
             'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
             'NAME': 'your_database_name',
             'USER': 'your_mysql_user',
             'PASSWORD': 'your_mysql_password',
             'HOST': 'localhost',
             'PORT': '3306',
         }
     }
     ```

5. Run database migrations:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

7. Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to access the application.

## How It Works

1. **User Registration**: Users can register and create an account.
2. **Login**: Users can log in to the system to access the application.
3. **Location Tracking**: The application uses Google Maps API to track and display the user's real-time location.
4. **SOS Signal**: In case of an emergency, users can send an SOS with their current location, alerting volunteers and emergency contacts.
5. **Volunteer Response**: Nearby volunteers receive the emergency alert and can navigate to the person in need.
